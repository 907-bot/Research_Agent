# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT GUIDE FOR HUGGING FACE SPACES

## Files to Upload

1. **app.py** - Main application file (already created)
2. **requirements.txt** - Dependencies (already created)  
3. **README.md** - Space description (already created)

## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Hugging Face Account
- Go to https://huggingface.co/
- Sign up or log in

### Step 2: Create a New Space
1. Click on your profile → "New Space"
2. Fill in details:
   - **Space name**: ai-research-agent (or your choice)
   - **License**: Apache 2.0 (recommended)
   - **Select SDK**: Gradio
   - **Space hardware**: CPU basic (free tier is sufficient)
   - **Public or Private**: Your choice

### Step 3: Upload Files
You can upload files in two ways:

#### Option A: Using Git (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone your space repository
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-SPACE-NAME
cd YOUR-SPACE-NAME

# Copy the three files to this directory
# - app.py
# - requirements.txt  
# - README.md

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI Research Agent"
git push
```

#### Option B: Using Web Interface
1. Go to your space on Hugging Face
2. Click "Files" tab
3. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
4. Upload app.py, requirements.txt, and README.md
5. Commit the changes

### Step 4: Wait for Build
- The space will automatically build and deploy
- This takes 2-5 minutes typically
- You'll see build logs in the "Logs" section

### Step 5: Test Your Space
- Once built, the interface will appear
- Try the example queries
- Share your space URL!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build fails with package errors**
   - Check requirements.txt formatting
   - Ensure no typos in package names

2. **Model download timeout**
   - The sentence-transformers model downloads on first run
   - This is normal and happens only once
   - Give it 2-3 minutes

3. **Search not working**
   - DuckDuckGo might rate-limit requests
   - Wait a few seconds between searches

4. **Memory errors**
   - Upgrade to a better hardware tier (free tier should work though)
   - Consider using a smaller embedding model

## Performance Tips

- First search is slower (model loading)
- Subsequent searches are faster
- Average query time: 10-30 seconds
- Works best with specific queries

## Customization Options

You can modify app.py to:
- Change the theme: `theme=gr.themes.Soft()` → try Glass, Monochrome, etc.
- Adjust search parameters: SEARCH_RESULTS, TOP_PASSAGES
- Add more example queries
- Change colors and styling
- Add authentication if needed

## Space Settings

In your space settings, you can:
- Enable/disable discussions
- Set hardware (upgrade if needed)
- Add secrets for API keys (if you extend functionality)
- Configure sleeping behavior
